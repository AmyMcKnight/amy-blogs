<p>Hi there and welcome to my coding blog. My name is Amy McKnight and this is my journey.</p>

<p>I am an advanced beginner web developer. I started learning HTML about 10 years ago. But, that is where I stopped… with HTML. You see I switched to using a CMS. If I had chosen WordPress I would have been golden. But I choose Joomla! and I never fully understood what was going on under the hood.</p>

<p>I could build useful, functional sites. I envied the people who created the platforms I used. I thought they must have advanced degrees in computer science. I figured I was destined to be a consumer of products made by people smarter than me. Such is life. I would make the best of what I knew.</p>

<p>Then two things happened around the same time this past summer (2015). 
	<ol>
		<li>1. I discovered almost all of my Joomla! sites had been hacked.</li> 
		<li>2. I heard a story on NPR about people changing their life by learning to code. Really code. From scratch.</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>I didn’t know how to fix my sites. That made me angry with myself. The NPR story gave me hope. People were learning to code in months not years. There was hope for me.</p>

<p>Come hell or high water I am going to get the knowledge I need to become an expert web developer.</p> 

<p>I've looked around for a coding bootcamp to attend. I and quickly learned that the “best” ones seemed to run in the thousands of dollars. Since I don’t have a spare $1,000 per month lying around. I'm going to work hard to find free and low cost option. I want to chart and share a path that will be accessible by most anyone no matter their financial background.</p>

<p>Warning: I learn best by drinking at the fire hydrant. I try to get as much exposure from as many good sources as I can until it clicks. That may mean powering through a variety of web design course learning a little from all. I will be sharing what I feel are the pros and cons of each option as I go. I reserve the right to change my mind.</p>

<p>I would love to hear from you! Please leave me a comment on any article that you find interesting or check me out on twitter.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>

<p>All the best!</p>

<p>Amy</p>
