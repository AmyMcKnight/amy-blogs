It is 8:19 p.m. And I am so reay for bed. And I am going. Soon

To day started at 4:20 something. I was up before my alarm looking forward to coding in peace and quiet.  I had been working through Chris Pines ruby book online. But when Conrad decided that he wanted to join me in my coding adventure. He got the new improved updated version. Of course. 

So, I've back tracked a little and am reviewing this new edition. I can see that he has made some changes since he published that first online copy. Different jokes and antidotes. Some of the challenges have been tweaked.

Last week we were on "vacation" and so I didn't get to do as much coding as I wasn't going to bed early or waking up early. Also didn't want to be totally antisocial. It was, supposed to be a family vacation. 

Today was a real jolt. I had a customer waiting from me as I was walking into the shop with 'Lil Bit. It was 9:30. We don't open until 10. Her timing was perfect. She had been waiting for us to reopen for a week and a half. 

She was one of many.

Conrad and Jamel were killing it. We must have gotten in 20 or more computers. I lost count. But they had everything diagnosed and many things fixed before 4. Ms. Margaret the customer who was waiting first thing in the morning, she had her computer back well before we closed. We more than enough time for her to call and me to walk her through reconnecting her internet.

Today was almost busy enough to keep me from repetitivley checking my phone to see if I had gotten an email response from the video I sent. Almost.

It has been officially 24 hours. It is a Monday. They start classes every Monday. They are coming off a holiday weekend. I emailed a founder. He's a busy person. He probably has a ton of emails.  It's only been 24 hours.

The things you tell yourself when you are trying to patiently wait but are hoping for an answer soon. 

8:35 p.m. got to go. Really need to get to bed soon. I have more than an hours worth of things to do before I go.
