I am continuing in my journey to understand how to code and understand how people teach coded. I ran a cross a video that started off as a blog post that describes the way I learn things. 

It was written by Mattan Griffel, and from what I can tell he had an idea for an online app decided to try to find someone to help him make it and then realized he would be better off learning to code so that he could make it himself. 

Since then he taught himself Rails and has taught at one of the coding bootcamps. 

I had heard his presentation before but I didn't fully get it the first time around. But now having spent some time coding. It makes so much more sense. 

In a nutshell he encourages you to go through a lot of different resources to try to learn whatever you are wanting to learn as each different resource will have it's own slant and where as you may not get it with one, the other might make the light bulb turn on. 

I'm finding that to be true. The more that I try out different resources the more I understand and the more I see ways that work and ways that don't work as well to teach adult learners.

Take Learn.co for example. I signed up for it yestarday. It has a free course that preps students to take their online bootcamp. Before you can start the course you have to download their proprietery learning enviroment. 

It took an evening and the morning to download and configure and that is on a high speed connection. 

What it seems to do is interface with git and github so that the beginner doesn't have to learn how to use git commands. 

I totally get the idea but I don't like it. It changed my terminal. When I mentioned that on slack someone posted, "Oh you can (insert direction that I don't understand) and you'll get it right back.

Right. 

So that is one thing but outside of that they are presenting the information a little differently than other programs have presented it. I've have caught a few gems. like how you can run programs from irb. That was neat. 

Let's see, also I am really liking the idea of using git to host lessons and having students interact with git. But I think you should just teach raw git. and the comandline. 

Like instead of making a person build website part of the application would be to learn enough command line and git to do some part of the application through git. 

The more I learn the more I feel like that is fundamental. I want to keep making progress on ruby but I feel that I NEED, MUST, HAVE TO, DO NOT PASS GO. Learn to use git and git hub. I need to learn it well enough to explain it to a beginner and get them up and running. 

So this course, if nothing else will give me some practice with that.
