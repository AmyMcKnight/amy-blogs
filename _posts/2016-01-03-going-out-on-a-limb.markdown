Today is the last day of our vacation. It was also the day that I was finally able to complete the video application for a scholarship to go to the bootcamp that I was accepted into right before Christmas. 

It is truly all or nothing. That is I either get a full scholarship or I'm back at square one continuing to plug along on my self paced coding journey. 

There is a part of me that wants to go the "self-taught programmer" route. That part of me that likes to feel that I can do anything that I can put my mind to doing. Which I can. My husband said so:

Conrad: "You can do whatever you really want to do."
Amy: "No, I can't."
Conrad: "Yes you can."
Amy: "Not really. I can't be a rocket scientist."
Conrad: "Yes you could."
Amy: "No, I really can't."
Conrad: "Yes you could. If you really wanted to  you would find scholarships to go back to school. You would find a way to take classes. It might take you the next 20 years but you'd do it."

That's one of the reasons I married him. But back to the subject at hand. I don't want to take more time than necessary. The older I get the more I am aware of how much time I've used. Time is precious. So even though I know that I COULD find a way to get this done on my own. I really hope that a door is opened so that I don't have to.

So I'm totally hanging out on a limb. Praying that there will be a sweet peice of fruit on the end and that I don't hear it snap under the weight of a disapointed dream. 

It has been sent. All I can do is wait. 

How have you put yourself out on a limb? Did you get the fruit? Did the limb break? I'd love for you to tell me about it in the comments.
