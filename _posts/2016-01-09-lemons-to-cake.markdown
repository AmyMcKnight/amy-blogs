If I've learned anything over the last six months and alomst 60 episodes of the [CodeNewbies.com](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast) is that it there isn't much out there in the way of sturctured group educational resources for the those that have enough presences of mind to want to change their situation but not enough money to really do a bootcamp.

One day when I'm not trying to write at 9:00 pm when I have to wake up at 4:30. I'll have to do a review of what I've tried so far.

Now there are people like my husband and Zed Shaw who both believe that one need not take a coding bootcamp to become a coder and that the vast majority of bootcamp are scams taking money from people who believe in stuff like get rich quick schemes. 

(yeah, it was rough hearing it)

But I truly believe that there is a place for group learning especially for those who want to be more than a cowboy/girl coder. As I tweeted last week there is something to be said for working with a group. There is something to be had in helping and knowing that you have people who can help you. 

I think the biggest problem comes for those of us who are big on desire and short on funds is just that. We can see what we want but that experience is usually had for more than we currently have or maybe have ever had in our bank accounts. 

What can be done for those who want to change that?

Provide an example and a path. So for the moment I've given up on the idea of attending any high priced online bootcamp. The funds just aren't there and there are no real options outside of going into debt. 

Actually I'm going to take that back I think that there actually are some places that take the money on the backend after they ensure that they have given you the skills to get a job. But I didn't find one that fit with the time commitment that I'm able to give. 

So, I'm in the process of rerouting my path to make one for myself that one day (hopefully soon) I'll be able to help other follow. 

Getting a no was not totally unexpected but still not what I was hoping for but it will surely make for an amazing start to a very tangy cake.
