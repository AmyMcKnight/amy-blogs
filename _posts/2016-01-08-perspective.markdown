One of the nice things about owning a small brick and mortar shop is that you get to meet the public. Since our business is computer repair we meet all types.

In the last two days, I've talked with two women. One a long time customer another a new one a walk in.

One is very well off the other is living hand to mouth. 

That put things into perspective for me. I may not be where I want to be but I'm so far from where I could be.

At the moment my lack of finances may keep me from achieving my goals in the most direct way. But I am blessed to know that there are goals to be achieved. 

I'm blessed.
