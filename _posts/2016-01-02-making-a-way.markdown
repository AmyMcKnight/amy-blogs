I'm not sure if they were talking about a actually gift or a talent. But this evening I didn't get to do too much coding. Ok, I actually didn't do much more than look at some code that I had written last week. 

But I wasn't being delinquent. Promise. I was working on a video application to apply for a scholarship that is yet to be created, hopefully, for me.

One of my "gifts" has been that of mastering tools to make them do what I need them to do. The current tool that I'm using right now is a peice of white board animation software. 

So instead of just writing an email saying:
>"Listen, I really love your program! I've tried out your intro and it has some of the best information that I've gone over paid or free. I totally want to be amoung those who have gone through your bootcame and done something great. I just don't have the funds. So could you help a sista out?"

Ok, so I actually would never, ever, in this life write something like that. But that is probably how it would feel to the founder. Besides for all it's good asside from emojis and smilie faces it is hard to really express your feelings through email. 

So I'm going out on a limb here. I'm totally putting myself out there and jumping in with both feet. I'm asking a pretty big ask. I want to make it count.

If it seem like I'm being cryptic, it is because I don't want to call out the program. If everything works out, and even if it doesn't (I've spent going on three days working on that video, somebody has got to see it!) I'll probably post the video on this blog later on. 

But for now, I'm just going to keep going send it over and hope for the best.

We will see if my talents and the gift of a video will make a way for me to attend an online coding bootcamp this year.

What is the craziest thing you have done to "make a way" for yourself? Please, take a moment to tell me about it in the comments!
