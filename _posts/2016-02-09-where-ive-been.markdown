So, a lot has happend in the last 23 days since I last posted on this blog. I want to start back posting daily (trying to beat my last streak).

When it comes to creative things, if you give me an idea of what I need to do and the materials, I'm good to go. I can build on what I know and use that to go forward.

I really wish that were the same for programming. But this is a whole new (fun) ballgame. In the absense of other learners at the same place as me or instructors charting the same path, I have had to got it on my own. This has sent me down more than one rabbit hole in search for some solution that will work with my situation. 

That tendency to continue to look for a better solution may have actually worked out for me. Ok you have to follow this. I was working on Chris Pines Programming book. But my husband, Conrad, who also has an interest in programming, and had started working throught the book with me. We wanted to work on it together. So I told him that I would stop working on that book and find something else to do. 

We had planned to go from Chris Pines book to Zed Shaw's book following an outline I had found on the internet. That left me looking for another Ruby resource to continue studying with. 

Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial is an often mentioned resources. And I had read a little of it on my phone a couple days before so I decided to go and check it out. 

What I read looked promising, I was just reading the intro and he was talking about how his program would prepare you for... and he listed several bootcamps. As I was going through the list I had looked at or heard mention of most of them. But there was one that I hadn't don any research on. That was Launchschool. 

Huh, what's that one?

So I opened their link into a new tab to check them out. From go I was drawn in. Their headline:

## The Slow Path for Serious Beginners to a Career in Software Development

Totally got me. Tell me more.

As I read the "Is this for me?" section I started to smile bigger and bigger until jumped up and did a dance. Seriously. So glad that no one was watching because I can't dance. 

They weren't hard selling. They didn't promise the moon. In fact they were almost discouraging people from joining their program. This is what you get. Do you want it? Are you sure?

I had spend the last six months trying to find an online solution that would take me from where I was to where I want/need to be to get a job as a full-stack programmer. Most places promise the moon but don't really deliver. This place didn't promise any thing except stress and hard work that would be worth it in the end.

This was looking to be the real deal. So I clicked the sign up button. I wanted to see if this was as good as it seemed. I saw they were intergrated with Github. Nice. 

I read the first articles and watched the first video and I was sold. And they were not trying to sell! That is what got me. As a person who has done a vareity of sales job since my mid-teens. I know the tricks. But I also can appreciate a product that is crafted to appeal to the audience it was made for. Launchschool appealed to me. 

I wanted to learn more about them so I looked to see if they had facebook and twitter pages. As I was reading through their twitter feed. I saw that they were giving out a scholarship in conjunction with Women Who Code of all thing! And that I still had time to apply!

To say I was excited and motivated to pull out all of the stops would be an understatement. I knew I would be going up against other women I needed to stand out. So I spent a week working on a video to express my deep interest interest. 

I will know the results in the next week. 

Stay tuned.
