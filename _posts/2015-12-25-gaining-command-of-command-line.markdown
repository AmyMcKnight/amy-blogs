Wow, it's January 1, 2016. A new year and a new opportunity to make a difference in my life and the lives of others. I've never been one for making resolutions. But here are a few things that I would like to do in the coming year. I'll be adding to this page and editing it as I go through the next 364 days. For now here is what I have on my list:

1. Master git/github.
2. Master blogging with Jekyll.
3. Blog daily.
4. Code daily.
5. Finish Chris Pines Ruby book.
6. Finish Zed Shaw's Ruby book.
7. Post to Medium weekly.
8. Find someone to help with their coding journey.
9. Imporve CSS Skills
10. Help more people get on the web.
11. Get remote development job.
