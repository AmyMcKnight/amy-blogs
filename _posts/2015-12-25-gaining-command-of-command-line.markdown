<p>Wow, it's January 1, 2016. A new year and a new opportunity to make a difference in my life and the lives of others. I've never been one for making resolutions. But here are a few things that I would like to do in the coming year. I'll be adding to this page and editing it as I go through the next 364 days. For now here is what I have on my list:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Master git/github.</li>
        <li>Master blogging with Jekyll.</li>
        <li>Blog daily.</li>
        <li>Code daily.</li>
        <li>Finish Chris Pines Ruby book.</li>
        <li>Finish Zed Shaw's Ruby book.</li>
        <li>Post to Medium weekly.</li>
        <li>Find someone to help with their coding journey</li>
        <li>(. . .to be continued.)</li>
    </ol>
