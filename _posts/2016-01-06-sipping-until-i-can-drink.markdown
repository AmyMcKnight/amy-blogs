I really want to go to join the firehose project. There. You know to where my hopes and dreams for jumpstarting learning to code are focused. From all the reviews I've read (and I've read a lot) it seems to be some what of an antibootcamp. 

In another post, I'll share a complete list of why I as a person in the market to up my skills with help would pick them over other oferings on the market. But for the moment, I'll just share what I'm planning to do in the mean time as I am waiting for the oppertunity (a door to open on my side or theirs) so I can start that program. 

One of the reasons I like their program is that they are very upfront about what you will learn. You don't have to wait until they have your money and you are in thier program, and commited to a point, to know where they are going to take you. 

That combined with the fact that they really let you try out their program to see how it works and if I will work for you is an added plus.  

So, here is how I plan to proceed. I am going to study the shadows until I can come into the light. That sounded cryptic. Here let me show you:

![The Firehose Project Course Overview](/img/fhp-course.png)

As you can see the course is based around several projects. I love projects! If you were to click on the arrows you would be able to see even more of the outline of what you will be doing/covering. 

So, as I wait, here is how I plan to proceed. I'm going to finish up the following to books on ruby:
[Chris Pine's Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/)

[Zed Shaw's Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/)

I have the paid/updated versions of both resources. They should give me a good foundation in Ruby before I jump in to learning rails. After that I'm going to start working on finding free resources that parallel to what is being covered in the program. 

Now you may ask, Amy, why would you do it that way? If you can find the resources for free why take the course. Two reasons:

 1. They craft the program to suit the students needs. So if I come in with extra knowledge, they will just find more work for me to do. So I'll actually get more information and learning resources if I come to the program with a level of understanding and am not starting from the total bottom. 
 2. You can not manufacture working as a Jr. Developer with a team. You start working a project with others as a Jr. Developer from the beginning. That is impotant to me. 

So that is my plan. I'll be sharing my progress as I go. Who knows along the way I may just decided to go it on my own. I may find a way to meet the second challenge outside of a program. I'm sure I could but until then at least I am making progress toward a goal.

If you are self-taught, how did you find a way to stay on track? I'd love to hear about it in the comment's below.
