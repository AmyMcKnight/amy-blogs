So today I signed up to do the intro course for the learn.co online bootcamp. 

I actually started the process of signing up last night but there was an error that didn't seem to get corrected until today.

Interesting start.

The more of these courses I try both expensive and free the more I realize that they are very similar.

And the more I see that it is true that you can find most of the information online for free.

I think that it all boils down to how much addional support each program is willing to provide over and above the curriculum. 

So, amazing support can range from a hundred dollars or so a month to over $2000 - $3000. It is totally a matter of what you don't know will break the bank.

The information is there for the taking. The question is who is best at leading you down the path to know what is worth taking and what should be left by the wayside.
