I had a great mentoring session this moring. I new what I wanted to learn and Ionica was able to help me start to make progress toward my goal. I'm taking a short break from my work studying ruby. 

I'll be back at it tomorrow. But for the next few weeks my time will be split between two worlds. Building for myself and building for my story. 

You see I get it now more than ever when people say you have to:

>Be the change you want to see in the world.

When they say you sometimes have to cut the path for others to follow, I get it. But I've never really done it. I usually jump on ships that are already moving. I'm not the one to push it off. 

Not until now. 

I have a vision of what I want to do and the story that has to be told inorder for me to effectively do it. Because that is all that I have to work with my story. I actually did something like this before. I washed diapers in my bath tub for a year not because I didn't have a washing machine (I did).

I did it for the people who didn't have a washing machine. I pushed myself through post partum tiredness. I pushed myself dispite the lack of sleep that comes with a newborn. I push myself to mastitis. In retrospect it was kinda dumb.

I get it now. The group that I was hoping to inspire unfortunately really weren't that intersted. But my story has been able to inspire others and it has helped to pave the way for other opportunities to help.

But that is another story for a different blog.

I don't have money but I have a passion to learn and a passion to help others like me who have a passion to learn but not a lot of resources. Come what may, I'm going to get the money to fund my idea and I'm going to do it in a way that I can show that person who is willing to hustle and work how to do.

I won't say all but so many of the stores of people who have "made it" in tech are by people who were already half-way there when they started. I want to hear stores of those who started with nothing and rose. That will be my story. My goal for 2016 is to write it. More than that to live it not as a fiction but as a blueprint.
